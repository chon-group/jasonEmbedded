|Embedded artificial intelligence in Internet of Things (IoT) devices is presented as an option to reduce connectivity dependence, allowing decision-making directly at the edge computing layer.The Multi-agent Systems (MAS) embedded into IoT devices enables, in addition to the ability to perceive and act in the environment, new characteristics like pro-activity, deliberation, and collaboration capabilities to these devices. A few new frameworks and extensions enable the construction of agent-based IoT devices. However, no framework allows constructing them with hardware control, adaptability, and fault tolerance, besides agents’ communicability and mobility. This project presents an extension of the [Jason framework](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason) for developing Embedded MAS with BDI agents capable of controlling hardware, communicating, and moving between IoT devices capable of dealing with fault tolerance.|
